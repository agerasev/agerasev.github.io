## Before university

The last two years of my high school I was studying in [Specialized Educational Scientific Center (SESC NSU)](https://sesc.nsu.ru/). That's when I became interested in computer science and programming. I was learning C and a little C++ by myself and tryed to develop simple computer games.

## University

After school I've entered [Novosibirsk State University (NSU)](https://nsu.ru/) at the Department of Physics.
One year later I've chosen the Chair of Physics and Technics Informatics, so for all subsequent years I've been learning computer science along with physics and mathematics, as you can see in the program following.

### Education program

## Postgraduate

While studying at the NSU I've got my Bachelor's and Master's degrees. The researches for these degrees I've carried out at the [Budker Institure of Nuclear Physics (BINP)](https://inp.nsk.su/).
There I went for my postgraduate education. Today I'm working on my Ph.D. at BINP.
